.SH NAME
hsh \- simple UNIX command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
hsh is a simple UNIX command line interpreter.

It reads commands from standard input and executes them.
The shell works in interactive mode and non-interactive mode.

In interactive mode, a prompt is displayed and the user can type commands.

In non-interactive mode, commands can be piped into the shell
or read from a file.

If a command contains a slash (/), the shell tries to execute it directly.

If the command does not contain a slash, the shell searches
for it in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.

If the command does not exist, an error message is printed
to standard error.

.SH BUILTINS
.TP
.B exit

($) exit

.br
$ cat file | ./hsh
.RE

.SH RETURN VALUE
The hsh shell returns 0 when it exits normally.
